## Usage

### Input Material Properties

1. Enter the following material properties in the input form:
   - **Yield Strength (psi)**: The stress at which the material begins to deform plastically.
   - **Ultimate Strength (psi)**: The maximum stress the material can withstand.
   - **Elastic Modulus (psi)**: The ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region.
   - **Percent Elongation**: The percentage the material stretches before failure.

2. Click on the **Generate Graph** button to calculate and visualize the stress-strain curve.

### Stress-Strain Curve

- The curve is divided into two regions:
  1. **Elastic Region**: Linearly increasing stress up to the yield point.
  2. **Plastic Region**: Stress increases with strain according to the strain-hardening model.

### View Data Points

- Stress and strain values for each point on the curve are displayed in a tabular format.

## References and Formulas

- **Elastic Region**: \( \sigma = \varepsilon \times E \)
- **Plastic Region**: 
  \[
  \sigma = S_y + (S_u - S_y) \times \left(\frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_f}\right)^n
  \]
  - \(\sigma\): Stress
  - \(\varepsilon\): Strain
  - \(E\): Elastic modulus
  - \(S_y\): Yield strength
  - \(S_u\): Ultimate strength
  - \(\varepsilon_f\): Strain at failure
  - \(n\): Strain hardening exponent
